# Self Discovery Sentence Completion (Unfinished)
- completed Intro up to Negative feelings, about 50% done.
# How To Use

To use Self-Discovery Sentence Completion select a topic then complete the sentences that appear.

Write as many completions as you can before the timer runs out. There will be 6 stems for each topic.

Don't worry if your answer makes sense or not just write something.

The purpose of this exercise is to expose important information in your subconscious mind.

Once this information is in your conscious mind you can begin to understand it and process it.

This will bring you better self knowledge and ultimately better self-esteem.

At the end of the exercise you will be able to review your answers and save them for future examination.

These exercises are taken from Nathaniel Branden's book The Art of Self-Discovery.

The more you invest into these exercises, the more effective they will be.

Please consider purchasing Nathaniel Branden's book (it's very rare) and consider donating at 13retonnianWebDevelopment.com to help me improve and make more self-esteem building software.
